addAttributeToFilter is a method that can be called on EAV collections in Magento 1 and Magento 2. This includes product collections, category collections, customer collections and many more. In short, it adds a condition to the WHERE part of the MySQL query used to extract a collection from the database, therefore allowing you to filter the collection by custom conditions.
