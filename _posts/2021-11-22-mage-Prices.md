### Regular price


### Special price
A special price can be offered for a designated period of time. During the specified time period, the special price appears instead of the regular price, followed by a notation that shows the regular price.

### Tier price
Tier pricing lets you offer a quantity discount from a product listing or product page in the storefront. The discount can be applied to a specific store view or customer group or shared catalog.

The tier price can be updated with the import/export functions.


### Regular price Vs final price
Price in the sense of cost of the product.
