The format follows Semantic Versioning rules for any @api annotated by code:

- The MAJOR version increments when incompatible API changes are made.
- The MINOR version increments when backward-compatible functionality has been added or if the moduleâ€™s customization points have changed.
- The PATCH version increments when backward-compatible bug fixes occur.
