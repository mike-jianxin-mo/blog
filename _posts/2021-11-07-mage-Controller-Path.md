### Controller Path
Ref: https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/architecture/archi_perspectives/components/modules/mod_and_areas.html

For deeper directory structures, the controller folders are separated with an underscore (_). For example:
```
catalog/product_compare/add = Magento/Catalog/Controller/Product/Compare/Add.php
```
