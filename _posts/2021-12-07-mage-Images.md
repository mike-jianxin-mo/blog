### Add new image type
1. In admin panel, select Stores > Attributes > Product. Then click on 'Add New Attribute'. Letâ€™s create attribute named 'Diamond Icon'. 
2. Now we need to assign that attribute in proper attribute set. For that, go to Stores > Attributes > Attribute set. Now select the particular attribute set in which you want to add your custom attribute. Drag and drop your custom attribute <strong>in images group</strong> as shown in the image below.
