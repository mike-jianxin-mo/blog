### Catalog Price vs Cart Price Rule
Both Catalog and Cart Price Rules are a great way to manage discounts on your store. Though their purpose is mentioned in their title, some people still find it confusing to differentiate between them.

They may serve the same functions, but in reality, they are totally different.

As we've already mentioned, Catalog Price Rules are applied in catalog, on product pages, before a product is added to the cart. Correspondingly, customers can see discounted prices while browsing through the catalog.
