### Credit Memo
A credit memo is a document that shows the amount that is due the customer for a full or partial refund. The amount can be applied toward a purchase or refunded to the customer. You can print a credit memo for a single order, or for multiple orders as a batch. Before a credit memo can be printed, it must first be generated for the order. The Credit Memos view (Sales > Credit Memos) lists the credit memos that have been issued to customers.

##### Refund method
The payment method for the order—account credit, online refund, or offline refund—determines the method by which you refund an order:

- An order that was placed using a credit account can be refunded to the respective account:

  - Store Credit
  - Payment on Account
  - Company Credit
  
- An order that was paid by credit card through a payment gateway is refunded online by the payment processor.

- All online refund types can be refunded offline as well.
  
- An order that was paid by Cash on Delivery (COD) or by check or money order is refunded offline.
